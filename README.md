VectorSix
=========

Application Server and IDE


The initial idea was to develop a leightweight CMS like system that supports the concept of frontend editing and a plugin mechanism to easy extend the system. So it took me about 4 Months to develop the first Version. In the end i had my own cms in my hands but i wasnt that happy with it i wantet to make it even better.

So i startet to plan again. But this time i will not build a CMS system. This time i will build something like a Backend and interface generator. The new VectorSix should be abel to be everything it wants because you could build a CMS with it but you could also build a completely other Application. 

The reason why i do this is the fact that i dont want to Code the same schematics and concepts for again and again for every project.
So the idea is to build something like a Webapp Builder. That generates a Application written in a Beautifull and easy readable PHP MVC structure.

The technology of VectorSix should be based on the following products:
+ jQerry
+ Bootstrap
+ Smarty Template engine

And iam still looking after products for:
+ Minimizer
+ Pdf Generator
+ Mailer
+ Json RPC
+ Validation
+ DB abtraction Layer

So as you see this project is allready in production while on the sametime i have to finish the concept. I know that this could go really worse but lets hope it doesnt ^^

So this is the first time i put my Sources on GitHub. You are free to use and Copy my code or to send me ideas or bugs you find. I try to use following Coding Standards.

+ PSG-0
+ PHP Doc
+ Js Doc
+ HTML 5
+ CSS 3

If you have any good ideas or critics feel free to contact me. But Please dont tell me that there is a othe project that does the samme i dont wana hear that and it properly would kill my notivation ^^

So thats it for the Readme

All the best and Happy Coding
